### how to enable Kubernetes service

ldapsearch -h <ldap-id> -x -v "uid=lch.go" -D "cn=yr.k" -W

Make network offerings private

SSVMS:
- global settings - set ntp 
- global settings - set SSL certificate

Configure user role expunge preferences:
- allow.user.expunge.recover.vm     - false
- allow.user.expunge.recover.volume - false
- expunge.delay - 604800 

upload custom logo and banners


incorrect login attempts
cloudmonkey update configuration name=incorrect.login.attempts.allowed value=20

certificate tls is for 2 years
test if loically deleted VM takes space from user - non expunged removed VMs still take resource from users.
change ntp of ssvms to local ntp
